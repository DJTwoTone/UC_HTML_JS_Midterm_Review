# Semantic HTML, CSS, and Git Challenge

## Objective
Convert a plain text document into a fully semantic, styled HTML web page. Manage your project using git for version control and deploy your final page as a live demo.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Setup and Version Control
- **Initialize Git Repository**: Start by initializing a git repository in your project folder.
- **Commit Regularly**: Make sure to commit your changes at significant steps, for example:
  - After creating the initial HTML structure.
  - After applying the base CSS styles.
  - After making the page responsive.

### Step 2: HTML Development
- **Semantic Markup**: Convert the provided text into HTML using semantic HTML5 elements such as `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and `<section>`.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that all images have `alt` attributes, maintain a proper heading hierarchy, and use labels for any form elements.

### Step 3: CSS Styling
- **Base Styling**: Create a CSS stylesheet to apply basic styles including fonts, colors, margins, and paddings.
- **Advanced Styling**: Use flexbox or grid layouts to organize content. Include styles for interactive elements like hover states.
- **Responsive Design**: Implement media queries to ensure your page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Step 4: Git Branching and Merging
- **Branching**: Create a new branch named `css-styling` when you start working on your CSS file.
- **Merging**: After completing your CSS, merge the `css-styling` branch back into the main branch. Resolve any conflicts if necessary.

### Step 5: Final Commit and Push
- **Final Review**: Check your website thoroughly to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
- **Final Commit**: Commit your final changes with a descriptive message.
- **Push to Remote**: Push your repository to a remote server like GitHub.

### Step 6: Deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Deploy your website using GitHub Pages or a similar service to provide a live demo of your work.
- **Submission Link**: Submit the URL of your repository and your live demo in Google Classroom.

## Deliverables
- A git repository with a complete commit history showing the progression of your project.
- The final version of your HTML and CSS files in the repository.
- A live demo of your webpage, deployed and accessible online.

Make sure to test your webpage thoroughly and ensure that all links, images, and layout components work as expected on different devices and browsers. Good luck!
